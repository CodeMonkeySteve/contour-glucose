Before you try this software:

WARNING

This is a very experimental piece of a software. It might damage your
glucose meter or make it unreliable.

The communication protocol this software uses to communicate to Bayer
Contour USB glucose meter is reverse engineered. The software has gone
through a very little of testing and I have no idea what it might do
for your meter. There is no approval of any sort by Bayer for using
this software. You use this software at your own risk. You have been
warned!
